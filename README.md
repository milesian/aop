This clojure library lets you wrap your stuartsierra components in the same way as AOP does
It's heavily based on [tangrammer/defrecord-wrapper](https://github.com/tangrammer/defrecord-wrapper) 

#### Releases and Dependency Information


```clojure
[milesian/aop "0.1.2-SNAPSHOT"]
```

```clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
               [com.stuartsierra/component "0.2.2"]
               [tangrammer/defrecord-wrapper "0.1.4-SNAPSHOT"]]
```


## Usage

Take a look at [milesian/BigBang](https://github.com/milesian/BigBang)




### Matcher implementation
Here you have a ComponentMatcher implementation, a component oriented matcher that uses the name of the component in the system and match using their protocols 
```
;; ...
(defn function-invocation
  [*fn* this args]
  (let [component-key (:bigbang/key (meta this))
        [fn-name fn-args]((juxt :function-name :function-args) (meta *fn*))
        who (:bigbang/who (meta (:wrapper (meta *fn*))))
        formatted-args (-> (st/replace (str fn-args) #"\[" "")
                                           (st/replace #"\]" "")
                                           (st/split #" ")
                                           (next)
                                           ((partial st/join " " )))]
    (format "%s->%s: %s %s" (if-not (nil? who)
                              (name who)
                              "REPL"
                              ) (name component-key) fn-name formatted-args)))

(defn logging-function-invocation
  [*fn* this & args]
  (println (function-invocation *fn* this args))
  (apply *fn* (conj args this)))
