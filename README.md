# milesian/aop

This clojure library lets you wrap your stuartsierra components with a component perspective as AOP does.

#### Releases and Dependency Information


```clojure
[milesian/aop "0.1.4"]
```

```clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
               [com.stuartsierra/component "0.2.2"]
               [tangrammer/defrecord-wrapper "0.1.6"]]
```

[milesian/aop](https://github.com/milesian/aop)  lets you wrap your stuartsierra/components in the same way as AOP does. 

... for those who aren't familiar with [AOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming), it is a programming paradigme that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. Examples of cross-cutting concerns can be: applying security, logging and throwing events, and as wikipedia explains:
> Logging exemplifies a crosscutting concern because a logging strategy necessarily affects every logged part of the system. Logging thereby crosscuts all logged classes and methods....


### what is it included?
It includes a **wrap function** that works as a customization system function and specific **component-matchers** to calculate the-component-place where we'll apply middleware.

### basic howto 
To simplify AOP meanings, let's try *refactoring* for a while two AOP concepts to quickly understand the functionality provided.

+ the **thing-to-happen** = aspect/cross-cutting concern
+ the **place-where-will-happen** = target


So, basically to include a new **thing-to-happen** in your component system, you need to define the **thing-to-happen** and the **place-where-will-happen**

   

#### **thing-to-happen**
It's **a function milddleware**, very similar to [common ring middleware](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Concepts#middleware)

```clojure
(defn your-fn-middleware
  [*fn* this & args]
  (let [fn-result (apply *fn* (conj args this))]
   fn-result))
```
   
#### **place-where-will-happen**
It's calculated with a [defrecord-wrapper.aop/Matcher](https://github.com/tangrammer/defrecord-wrapper/blob/master/src/defrecord_wrapper/aop.clj#L4) protocol implementation

```clojure
(defprotocol defrecord-wrapper.aop/Matcher
  (match [this protocol function-name function-args]))
```



### Minimal example
As you can see the options available to decide if the **thing** has to happen in current **place** are component protocol, function-name and function-args
Let's try to use this AOP stuff in a minimal example: 


#### 1. define protocols and component 
```clojure
(defprotocol Database
  (save-user [_ user])
  (remove-user [_ user]))

(defprotocol WebSocket
  (send [_ data]))

(defrecord YourComponent []
  Database
  (save-user [this user]
    (format "saving user: %" user ))
  (remove-user [this user]
    (format "removing user: %" user ))
  Websocket
  (send [this data]
    (format "sending data: %" data)))
   
```
#### 2. define your middleware to apply (thing-to-happen)

```clojure
(defn logging-middleware
  [*fn* this & args]
  (let [fn-result (apply *fn* (conj args this))]
   (println "aop-logging/ function-name:" (:function-name (meta *fn*)))
   fn-result))
```

#### 3. define your matcher (place-where-will-happen)

```clojure
;; maybe you want match all your component fns protocols

(defrecord YourComponentMatcher [middleware]
  defrecord-wrapper.aop/Matcher
  (match [this protocol function-name function-args]
    (when (contains? #{Database WebSocket} protocol))
    middleware))
    

;; or maybe you're only are interested in Database/remove-user function

(defrecord YourRefinedComponentMatcher [middleware]
  defrecord-wrapper.aop/Matcher
  (match [this protocol function-name function-args]
    (when (and (= Database protocol) (= function-name "remove-user")))
    middleware))
```



#### 4. wrap your system (apply conditional middleware to your components)
 
```clojure
;;  construct your instance of SystemMap as usual
(def system-map (component/system-map :your-component (YourComponent.)))

;; Using stuartsierra customization way
(def started-system (-> system-map
                        (component/update-system 
                         (comp component/start 
                               #(milesian.aop/wrap % (YourRefinedComponentMatcher. logging-middleware))))))
  
  ;; or, if you prefer a better way to express the same
  ;; you can use milesian/BigBang
(def started-system (milesian.bigbang/expand
                     system-map
                     {:before-start []
                      :after-start  [[milesian.aop/wrap (YourRefinedComponentMatcher. logging-middleware)]]}))

```
#### 5. try your wrapped-started-system
 
```clojure
;;  construct your instance of SystemMap as usual
(-> started-system :your-component (send "data"))
=> repl output: aop-logging/ function-name: send

```


## Let's match with component perspective 

milesian/aop includes a [Matcher](https://github.com/tangrammer/defrecord-wrapper/blob/master/src/defrecord_wrapper/aop.clj#L4-L5) implementation that **uses a stuartsierra/component perspective in contrast to** function and protocol perspective of [matchers](https://github.com/tangrammer/defrecord-wrapper/blob/master/README.md#matchers-available-in-tangrammerdefrecord-wrapper) included on more generic tangrammer/defrecord-wrapper lib
Also offers a simple "Dependency Component Query Oriented" that I found very useful to think/query the system in a component way :- in our component case is the same as straighforward way 

####  ComponentMatcher 
This implementation  uses the system component-id to match using its component protocols and the middleware fn to apply.

Example using previous example will match both protocols: Database and Websocket, and therefore all their related fns. Previous matchers examples used protocols and fn-names to do their works, now we are at a high level, a component level.

```clojure

(milesian.aop.matchers/new-component-matcher :system system-map 
                                             :components [:your-component] 
                                             :fn logging-middleware)]                                          
```

###  Dependency Component Query Oriented 
This project also contains two ComponentMatcher function constructors that let you match using a dependency component query point of view. 

Let's extend our data example adding a couple of components more:

```clojure
(defprotocol Greetings
  (morning [_]))

(defrecord GreetingsComponent [your-component]
  Greetings
  (morning [this]
    (send your-component "Morning, it's a great day here!"))

(defprotocol Connector
  (connect [_]))

(defrecord ConnectorComponent [greetings-component]
  Connector
  (connect [this]
    (morning greetings-component))
```
And also we'll need extend our system definition

```clojure
(def system-map (component/system-map   
                 :your-component (YourComponent.)
                 :greetings-components (->(GreetingsComponent.)
                                          (component/using [:your-component]))
                 :connector-component (->(ConnectorComponent.)
                                         (component/using [:connector-component]))))

```

#### ComponentTransitiveDependenciesMatcher fn constructor
**[new-component-transitive-dependencies-matcher](https://github.com/milesian/aop/blob/master/src/milesian/aop/matchers.clj#L33)** uses [stuartsierra/dependency transitive-dependencies](https://github.com/stuartsierra/dependency/blob/master/src/com/stuartsierra/dependency.clj#L19) to get all component dependencies for each component specified in `:components [...]` argument. 

```clojure
(milesian.aop.matchers/new-component-transitive-dependencies-matcher 
 :system system-map 
 :components [:your-component] 
 :fn logging-middleware)
;; it's the same as                                           

(milesian.aop.matchers/new-component-matcher 
 :system system-map 
 :components [:your-component :greetings-component :connector-component] 
 :fn logging-middleware)
 
```

 
#### ComponentTransitiveDependentsMatcher fn constructor
**[new-component-transitive-dependents-matcher](https://github.com/milesian/aop/blob/master/src/milesian/aop/matchers.clj#L40)** uses [stuartsierra/dependency transitive-dependents](https://github.com/stuartsierra/dependency/blob/master/src/com/stuartsierra/dependency.clj#L22) to get the all dependents components for each component specified in `:components [...]` argument.

```clojure
(milesian.aop.matchers/new-component-transitive-dependents-matcher 
 :system system-map 
 :components [:connector-component] 
 :fn logging-middleware)
;; it's the same as                                           

(milesian.aop.matchers/new-component-matcher 
 :system system-map 
 :components [:your-component :greetings-component :connector-component] 
 :fn logging-middleware)
 
```
