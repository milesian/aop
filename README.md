This clojure library lets you wrap your stuartsierra components in the same way as AOP does

#### Releases and Dependency Information


```clojure
[milesian/aop "0.1.2-SNAPSHOT"]
```

```clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
               [com.stuartsierra/component "0.2.2"]
               [tangrammer/defrecord-wrapper "0.1.4-SNAPSHOT"]]
```


## Usage

Take a look at [milesian/BigBang](https://github.com/milesian/BigBang)


### Matchers implementation

Here you have a ComponentMatcher implementation, a component oriented matcher that uses the name of the component in the system and match using their protocols 

```

 [milesian.aop/wrap (milesian.aop.matchers/new-component-matcher :system system-map :components [:c] :fn milesian.aop.utils/logging-function-invocation)]

```

Also you can use stuartsierra/dependency fns to reduce your components to match. Following this idea you can find 2 more matchers [new-component-transitive-dependencies-matcher](https://github.com/milesian/aop/blob/master/src/milesian/aop/matchers.clj#L33) and [new-component-transitive-dependents-matcher](https://github.com/milesian/aop/blob/master/src/milesian/aop/matchers.clj#L40)
